# basic-technical-documentation-page
This is a basic technical documentation page that utilizes HTML and CSS.

## Motivation

Become more familar with HTML 5 and CSS3 grid with a navbar.  Build my skills as a developer.  The ultimate goal is to become a Front-end developer in 2021.  I will be doing projects from freecodecamp.org and other resources in order to obtain my first developer position.  I built a basic technical documentation page to become more familiar with how a Wikipedia page works.  This is also a simple example of a basic technical documentation page that is simliar to a Wikipedia page.
